<p class= paragraphStyle><span class= "starter" >Man Eats Other Man's Face Off...</span>Out front of the Impact Hub Building on State Street in Salt Lake City, UT. Wild times we are living in indeed. Suspect is still on the loose, no weapon, but armed with teeth and dangerous. The local community says man looked like a zombie. That's right a real life freakin zombie. Straight off Walking Dead. Name bleieved to be <span id= suspect>Bogart Simpson</span>. Local police believe the new designer drug Flocka to be at blame. The local homeless population claims to know the suspect, and the majority beleives otherwise. They say he is just a crazy guy who prefers human flesh for dinner. In other news, at least the VSchool student body is safe. </p>

 <p class= makeWider><span class= starter>Chaos caused downtown Friday afternoon</span> when a frenzy of Lime Scooter riders casued mass hysteria amid a riot. 500 Limers converged at the crosswalk of State Street and West Temple right after a curch gathering let out. People from the group of scooter riders claim the act was not intentional. This initiated a stampede and 20 people were killed, none of which belonged to the Church of Mormon. Jesus Christ Church of Laterday Saints claims none of their members were killed, as they were saved by the grace of Joseph Smith! There will be a candle light vigil at 8PM this Sunday evening. The city is considering a ban of all rental scooters. The scooter company investors are not happy about this, as they feel the scooters have brought plenty of happiness to the community.This report brought to you by idiot Aaron Sanderson </p>
